# 🚀 Overview

**FinTrace AI** is a graph-based fraud detection intelligence platform that identifies complex financial crime patterns such as:

* 🔁 Circular money laundering (Cycle Rings)
* 🕸 Layered Shell Structures
* 💸 Smurfing (Fan-in / Fan-out patterns)
* 📊 Statistical Transaction Anomalies
* ⚠️ Risk-calibrated Suspicion Scoring

Built for investigative analysts, compliance teams, fintech systems, and regulatory use cases.

# 📊 Fraud Detection Logic

## 🔁 Cycle Detection

Detects closed loops in transaction graph.

```
A → B → C → A
```

Risk increases with:

* Smaller cycle length
* Repeated cycles
* High transaction value

---

## 🕸 Layered Shell Detection

Identifies intermediary chains used to obscure fund origin.

```
Origin → S1 → S2 → S3 → Destination
```

Risk increases with:

* Depth of layering
* Same timestamp clustering
* Reused intermediary accounts

---

## 💸 Smurfing Detection

Detects structured micro-transactions.

### Fan-In

Many senders → One receiver within 72h

### Fan-Out

One sender → Many receivers within 72h

---

## 📈 Anomaly Detection

Uses statistical deviation:

* Z-score based amount anomaly
* Unusual frequency spike
* Behavioral deviation

---

# 🎯 Risk Calibration Formula

Final Suspicion Score =

```
( Pattern Weight
+ Network Centrality Score
+ Transaction Volume Score
+ Behavioral Deviation Score )
```

Normalized between **0 – 100**
